#Algorithm to add two numbers ...#
 
 1. start
 2. define the data type - integer 
 3. Input the first number and assign to a  variable – A 
 4. Input the second number and assign to a variable –B 
 5. Add the two numbers and assign to a variable – C
 6. C = A + B 
 7. print C 
 8. Stop
 
 
 
 
 #..algorithm to find the factorial of a number# 
 1. start
 2.Input a positive integer number and assign to a variable – NUM
 3.Declare a variable – factorial and give it an initial value of 1
 4.Check that the user entered integer number and prompt them to try again if not.
 5.Initiate a loop 
          while NUM is greater than zero
               multiply factorial by NUM and store results in factorial
                substract 1 from NUM 
           End while loop
6.Print out factorial 
7.Stop 



#..algorithm to find the Fibonacci sequence #
1. start 
2. Define the data type – integer
3. Define the number of terms you want to calculate in the Fibonacci series - 5 
4. Declare  variable A1, A2, A3, A4, A5
5. Input a positive integer and assign to a variable – A1
6. Input a positive integer and assign to a variable – A2
7. Print A1 and A2
8. Initiate a loop  
         While A4 < A5 :
                let sum = A1 + A2 and store sum in A3 
                 A1 = A2 
                 A2 = A3 
                  sum = A1 + A2  and store sum in A4
                  A1 = A3 
                  A2 = A4 
                  sum = A1 + A2 and store sum in A5
           End loop
9. Print A1,A2,A3,A4,A5
  
  
  
  
  #..Write an algorithm to sort a given set of numbers (Bubble sort)#
  
1. start
2. Define the data type 
3. Write down the list of numbers and assign them to a variable – A
4. Define how you want them to be sorted – ascending order.
5. Check if each number in A is greater  than any other, if so, swap their positions
6. Repeat until each number in A Is greater than the one preceding it .
7. print A
8. stop
